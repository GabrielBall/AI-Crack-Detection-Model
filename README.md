# A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Methods for the Automated Detection of Structural Cracks
## Description
This repository contains the code for the EMAT31530 project. It includes two main files: Final_Code.pynb and Dino_SelfSupervised_Transformer.pynb. The Final_Code.pynb file comprises testing, validation, and comparison of various network architectures for crack classification. Dino_SelfSupervised_Transformer.pynb is a deprecated file that explores a self-supervised image transformer as part of future research endeavors.

### Final_Code.pynb
This Jupyter Notebook file encompasses the final codebase for the crack classification project. It includes:

Testing: Evaluation of the trained models on test data to assess their performance.

Validation: Validation of models during training to monitor their progress and prevent overfitting.

Comparison: Comparison of different network architectures, including performance metrics, visualizations, and analysis.

### Dino_SelfSupervised_Transformer.pynb
This Jupyter Notebook file contains the implementation of a self-supervised image transformer, Dino [1], which was explored as part of the project's future research section. However, please note that this file is deprecated, and its contents are not utilised in the current methodology.
