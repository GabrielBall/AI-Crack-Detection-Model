#A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Methods for the Automated Detection of Structural Cracks
##Description
This repository contains the code for a crack classification project. It includes two main files: Final_Code.pynb and Dino_SelfSupervised_Transformer.pynb. The Final_Code.pynb file comprises testing, validation, and comparison of various network architectures for crack classification. On the other hand, Dino_SelfSupervised_Transformer.pynb is a deprecated file that explores a self-supervised image transformer as part of future research endeavors.

###Final_Code.pynb
This Jupyter Notebook file encompasses the final codebase for the crack classification project. It includes:

Testing: Evaluation of the trained models on test data to assess their performance.
Validation: Validation of models during training to monitor their progress and prevent overfitting.
Comparison: Comparison of different network architectures, including performance metrics, visualizations, and analysis.

###Dino_SelfSupervised_Transformer.pynb
This Jupyter Notebook file contains the implementation of a self-supervised image transformer, referred to as Dino, which was explored as part of the project's future research section. However, please note that this file is deprecated, and its contents are not actively maintained or supported.
